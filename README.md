# Angel-Eyes
Artist 
About the artist Rosalee Harvey: 
Angel Eyes is a company that creates fashion for mostly women. It was created in 2012 and the work is represented by galleries, coffee shops, solo show openings, and group show of artists. The fashion is artistically styled after studying  and reaching a studio art degree. It is popular for those entranced in downtown culture. The bags are usually big enough for a book to fit inside while the lady has a cup a tea and coffee at a local shop. The artist loves music and likes to work with music artists and DJs  hosting Angel Eyes at parties.
